## Data source
I got the data from a free website called Data World.

## Data Visualization using Oracle Apex
By developing SQL queries and using Oracle APex Application - Page Designer, I designed and developed an appealing dashboard to illustrate trends.
This dashboard provides an insightful breakdown of the percentage of searches in the United States for the terms 'Midjourney', 'Stable Diffusion', and 'DALL-E' since January 2022.
